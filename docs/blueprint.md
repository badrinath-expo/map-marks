## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#3F51B5), inspired by cartography, to convey trust.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5F5), a desaturated shade of the primary, for a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Yellow-orange (#FFAB40) to draw the user's attention to actions.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, offering a clean, readable style suitable for displaying map details.
- Use distinct icons for each event type, such as a lightning bolt for power outages, to enhance the user's understanding.
- Maintain a clear, logical layout. The map should be the main element, with markers being prominent. Any controls are grouped together in an unobtrusive panel.
- Use subtle animations, like a zoom or a bounce, for placing or selecting markers, to draw attention and confirm actions.
